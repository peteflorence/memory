      "\n",
      "- (No memory) Constrain problem to only use current depth image, and constrain planning to be inside FOV\n",

      "- (Memory via full map, blur all measurements) Leak each voxel on each time step.  Must touch each voxel on each time step.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "- (Memory via full map, allowing for loop closure) Worst case, entire new map is built with each pose graph solve.  Would touch each $N_{mem} \\cdot N_{points}$ on each new measurement.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Available approaches either don't use memory, or don't address position uncertainty over time affecting obstacle configurations in a satisfactory way.\n",

      "### Proposed method\n",
      "\n",
      "- (Memory, but no map) Allow memory, and be able to use uncertainty, without $N_{mem} \\cdot N_{points}$ complexity for each step\n",
      "\n",
